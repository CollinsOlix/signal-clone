# signal-clone
Hello there! Collins here.
I built this Signal App clone to use as a pad to implement firebase on
I have always known firebase would be an important service to add to a developers stack
so with this projectm I basically use firebase to implement CRUD of elements in a database
also there are a few other exciting packages used to make the project seem more seamless
such as react-native-elements for already built components to speed up development 
and help performance
